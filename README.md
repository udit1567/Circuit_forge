# Circuit Forge - Exploring the World of Electronics and IoT
Welcome to Circuit Forge—a space where curiosity meets innovation! My name is Udit Maurya, and since late 2020, I’ve been diving deep into the fascinating world of electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT). This GitHub repository showcases some of the exciting projects I've built as part of my journey to understand and push the limits of technology.

From an early age, I've had an insatiable curiosity about how things work, especially in electronics. This passion led me to create Circuit Forge as both a personal exploration and a platform to share my projects with like-minded enthusiasts. You’ll find a wide variety of projects here, ranging from home automation to solar performance monitoring, and even RFID-based security systems.

Featured Projects
# 1. Home Automation with IoT
Using the versatile ESP8266 and ESP01, I built a home automation system that not only allows remote control of devices but also incorporates real-time weather forecasting. This system makes everyday life smarter by integrating temperature and humidity monitoring.

# 2. RFID-Based Door Lock and Attendance System
A sophisticated security system using RFID technology combined with cloud-based monitoring through the Blynk platform. It’s an innovative approach to automating attendance systems while ensuring security through an RFID-controlled solenoid lock.

# 3. Solar Energy Monitoring System
Harnessing the power of ESP8266 with voltage and current sensors, this project provides real-time data on solar panel performance. You can remotely control appliances and monitor energy usage via the Blynk app, helping optimize energy efficiency.

# 4. Autonomous Car
This project uses an Arduino Uno with ultrasonic sensors to build an autonomous car. Recently, I upgraded it by integrating an ESP32-CAM for real-time video feedback, expanding its capabilities into remote-controlled and camera-assisted navigation.

# 5. Ionic Wind Project
Exploring the science behind electrohydrodynamic propulsion, this project delves into creating an ionic wind generator using a flyback transformer. It’s a step towards alternative forms of propulsion and cooling systems.

# 7. ESP32-CAM Object Identification
This project combines ESP32-CAM with machine learning to create an intelligent object detection system. The camera captures real-time images, which are processed by a trained model to identify objects. It’s an application of IoT in machine vision.

# 8. Real-Time Solar Performance Monitoring System
An advanced system using ESP8266 to track solar panel performance. It measures voltage and current using sensors, calculates power output, and allows remote control of solar-powered appliances via the Blynk app.

# 9. Mini Electronics Projects
RGB Light Controller with ESP32: A web-based controller for RGB LED strips, allowing color changes via a web interface.
PIR Motion Sensor with ESP8266: A smart system to detect motion and notify the homeowner via a smartphone or smartwatch.
Web7Seg with ESP32: Control a 7-segment display through a web interface using ESP32.
GyroArm Control: Uses the MPU6050 sensor for motion detection to control a robotic arm.
AND, OR, NOR Logic Gates: A series of projects using transistors to create basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOR, demonstrating simple electronics principles.

# 10. Acoustic Levitation
Leveraging sound waves to suspend objects in mid-air, this project uses transducers controlled by Arduino Nano to demonstrate acoustic levitation, which has applications in material science and delicate object handling.

# 11. NanoPong Arcade: OLED Edition
A portable version of the classic Pong game, built using an Arduino Nano and a 0.96-inch OLED display. The game features scorekeeping via a TM1637 display and adds a fun, nostalgic element to modern electronics.

# 12. ESP32-Based Function Generator
A compact waveform generator using an ESP32 microcontroller to produce sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms. It integrates an OLED display for real-time feedback and a toggle switch for waveform selection.

# 13. Raspberry Pi Pico-Based Oscilloscope
This project turns the Raspberry Pi Pico into a portable oscilloscope by connecting it to a smartphone. It captures and displays electrical signals, providing a cost-effective, portable solution for hobbyists and engineers.
