# Circuit Forge - Exploring the World of Electronics and IoT
Welcome to Circuit Forge—a space where curiosity meets innovation! My name is Udit Maurya, and since late 2020, I’ve been diving deep into the fascinating world of electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT). This GitHub repository showcases some of the exciting projects I've built as part of my journey to understand and push the limits of technology.

From an early age, I've had an insatiable curiosity about how things work, especially in electronics. This passion led me to create Circuit Forge as both a personal exploration and a platform to share my projects with like-minded enthusiasts. You’ll find a wide variety of projects here, ranging from home automation to solar performance monitoring, and even RFID-based security systems.

Featured Projects
1. Home Automation with IoT
Using the versatile ESP8266 and ESP01, I built a home automation system that not only allows remote control of devices but also incorporates real-time weather forecasting. This system makes everyday life smarter by integrating temperature and humidity monitoring.

2. RFID-Based Door Lock and Attendance System
A sophisticated security system using RFID technology combined with cloud-based monitoring through the Blynk platform. It’s an innovative approach to automating attendance systems while ensuring security through an RFID-controlled solenoid lock.

3. Solar Energy Monitoring System
Harnessing the power of ESP8266 with voltage and current sensors, this project provides real-time data on solar panel performance. You can remotely control appliances and monitor energy usage via the Blynk app, helping optimize energy efficiency.

4. Autonomous Car
This project uses an Arduino Uno with ultrasonic sensors to build an autonomous car. Recently, I upgraded it by integrating an ESP32-CAM for real-time video feedback, expanding its capabilities into remote-controlled and camera-assisted navigation.

5. Ionic Wind Project
Exploring the science behind electrohydrodynamic propulsion, this project delves into creating an ionic wind generator using a flyback transformer. It’s a step towards alternative forms of propulsion and cooling systems.
