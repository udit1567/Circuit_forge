## 👋 Hi, I’m Udit Maurya

I’m a **Machine Learning & AI engineer** with a strong foundation in **embedded systems and electronics**, focused on building intelligent models that run efficiently on **edge and low-power devices**. My work sits at the intersection of **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and real-world hardware deployment**.

---

## 🎓 Education

- **B.S. in Data Science & Applications**
- **B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering**

This combination allows me to not only train and optimize models, but also **deploy them on constrained hardware**, where performance, memory, and power truly matter.

---

## 🤖 What I Work On

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning for real-world applications  
- Computer Vision and on-device inference  
- Edge AI / TinyML for low-power systems  
- Model optimization: **quantization, pruning, latency & FPS tuning**  
- Bridging ML pipelines with embedded and edge platforms  

I have **6+ years of experience** working with embedded and edge systems, and I’ve been **hands-on with electronics and hardware prototyping for over a decade**, which gives me a **practical, deployment-first approach to AI**.

## 🚀 Areas of Interest

- Edge AI & TinyML  
- Computer Vision on edge devices  
- Efficient ML inference (**TFLite, ONNX, custom runtimes**)  
- Low-latency & real-time AI systems  
- AI for IoT, smart sensing, and autonomous systems  

---

## 🧠 Approach & Philosophy

I’m especially interested in **making AI practical** — taking models out of notebooks and running them reliably on real devices. I enjoy pushing ML models to achieve **maximum accuracy and performance under strict hardware constraints**.

## 🛠️ Circuit Forge

This GitHub space is where I:

- Build and share **ML & Edge-AI projects**  
- Experiment with **model optimization and deployment**  
- Document **end-to-end AI systems**, from training to on-device inference  
- Explore how AI behaves in **real-world, resource-limited environments**

If you’re into **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, or Edge AI**, you’re in the right place.
