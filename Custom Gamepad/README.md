# 🎮 Customised Gyro Gamepad  

A DIY wireless **gyro-based gamepad** built with an **Arduino Nano**, **MPU6050 sensor**, **joystick**, **buttons**, and **ESP-01 WiFi modules**, communicating with a **Raspberry Pi Pico** as a USB receiver.  

This project enables **motion-controlled gaming** with a response time of ~10ms, providing **real-time orientation + button inputs** for PC games or other applications.

## 📷 Project Overview  

![IMG_2728](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59182767-de24-45a4-a98c-2036a4e41005)

The system works as follows:  
1. **Arduino Nano** reads input from:  
   - **MPU6050** → Detects angular motion & orientation.  
   - **Joystick** → Provides X & Y analog control.  
   - **Buttons** → Handle additional input actions.  
2. Data is sent wirelessly via **ESP-01 (Transmitter)**.  
3. **ESP-01 (Receiver)** passes data to a **Raspberry Pi Pico**.  
4. The **Raspberry Pi Pico** processes the data and acts as a **USB HID game controller**.

## 🚀 How It Works  

- **Step 1:** Arduino Nano collects orientation (gyro), joystick, and button data.  
- **Step 2:** Data is transmitted via **ESP-01** (UART communication).  
- **Step 3:** Another ESP-01 receives the data and forwards it to the **Pi Pico**.  
- **Step 4:** Raspberry Pi Pico interprets the signals and sends them as **HID gamepad inputs** to the PC.  

This creates a **wireless motion + button controller** for gaming or robotics.
